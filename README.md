# Algorithms & Data Structures

This repo contains the most frequently used Algoritms and Data Structures in the projects I have worked during my career. Some of these examples are built such that I always found really productive for mentoring purposes.

Please feel free to use and contribute if you would like to make this repo containing other data structures and algorithms.

## Real-Life Examples

These are recommended go-to data structures for some real-life Software examples. Some of these include my personal experience and some others are general knowledge I percieved from friends & fellows in the industry. Depending on the infrastructure, repository, team and business needs, some of these may not be directly applicaple. However, I have found these go-to data structures really productive during MVP stages of products I helped to build...

### Hash Table
- To look up data fast 
- Symbol table for database indexing
- Caching
- To store an image (1000 by 1000 pixels) as a bitmap

### Stack
- To store undo/redo operations in an image manupulation application.

### Queues
- Transport and operations research where various entities are stored and held to be processed later ie the queue performs the function of a buffer.
- To store the customer order information in a drive-in burger place. (Customers keep on coming and they have to get their correct food at the payment/food collection window.)
- To implement printer spooler so that jobs can be printed in the order of their arrival.

### Priority queues
- Process scheduling in the kernel

### Trees
- Parsers, Filesystem
- To store the possible moves in a chess game.

### Radix Tree
- IP routing table

### BSP tree
- 3D computer graphics

### Graphs
- Routing
- Networks of communication
- To store the genealogy information of biological species.
- To store the friendship information on a social networking site. i.e. who is friends with whom.
- To evaluate an expression (i.e., parse an input into semantics)

### Linked Lists
- To store social network “feeds”. You do not know the size, and things may need to be dynamically added.
